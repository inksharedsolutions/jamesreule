                        Many of us who were combat soldiers or marines in the Vietnam War still consider themselves as soldiers.  I served during what has been referred to as the “bloody years” of 1968-69.  Actually 1968 alone owns the title.  I am not a college graduate, but I ground out seven and a half years of college classes day and evening, at four different universities — majoring in nothing, and working full time while attending evening classes, . . . just like an infantry “grunt” did in Vietnam.  I was working almost 24-7 before and after Vietnam service.
